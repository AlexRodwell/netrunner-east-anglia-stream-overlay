# Netrunner stream overlay

## About

## Getting started

### Enviroment variables

### Development

1. Install [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en)
2. Download this git repository, either via [CLI](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Basics-Getting-a-Git-Repository) or Github download (if downloaded as a zip, ensure you extract its contents)
3. Using a CLI, navigate to the downloaded repositry via `cd ./netrunner-stream-overlay`
4. Run `npm i` in CLI to install the required packages/dependancies (npm is bundled with node.js, which will work, despite the project using [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/))
5. Create a `.env` file in the `./dashboard` directory of the project (or rename the `.env.example` to just `.env`), this stores the websocket URL/state.
6. Run the overlay/dashboard by navigation to `./dashboard` and running `npm run overlay`, the local webserver URL will be logged to console, navigate to that URL in your browser

### Deployment (production)

-   **Static host (overlay and dashboard)**: To setup the overlay and dashboard part of the overlay, you will simply need to run `npm run build`, let SvelteKit generate the files, and then upload the contents of the `./build` directory to your host of choice.
-   **Websocket server**: You will need a node.js host to run the websocket server. Upload/add the `websocket.js` file and have node run said file via `node ./websocket.js`. You will need to change `PUBLIC_WEBSOCKET_URL` to the URL of your hosted websocket, and `PUBLIC_WEBSOCKET_CONNECTION` to `TRUE` to utilise this functionality.

### Using the overlay

Inside OBS or a similar broadcast software, simply add a 'browser' source with the URL to one of the pages in the components section below, set it to a width/height of 1920x1080 and you should see it live update as you change values in the dashboard.

#### Components

-   **Combined overlay:** accessible at `/overlay`
-   **Timer:** Accessible at `/overlay/timer`
-   **Player:** For more refined control/placement of the play data
    -   **One:** Accessible at `/overlay/player/one`
    -   **Two:** Accessible at `/overlay/player/two`
